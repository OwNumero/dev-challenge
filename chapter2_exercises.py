# Exercises for chapter 2:

# Name: 10 day Dev Challenge
# by OwNumero
# 
# 
# Exercice 2.1: 
#
# when the number entered starts with a zero
# Python interprets it as a number base 8
# using numbers 0 through 7
# 
# 0 is 0
# 01 is 1
# 04 is 4
# 07 is 7
# 10 is 8
# 11 is 9
# note 08, 09 don't exist because they use 
# numbers after 7, which is the highest in
# base 8
#
# Exercise 2.2
#
# run the sequence as a script
# 5
# x = 5
# x + 1
# 6
#
# print each expression
# print 5
# 5
# print x + 1
# 6
#
# Note that the book hasn't explained how to save or run a script yet
#
#
# Exercise 2.3
#
# width = 17
# height = 12.0
# delimiter = ' . '
# 1. width/2
#    8
#    <type 'int'>
# 2. width/2.0
#    8.5
#    <type 'float'>
# 3. height/3
#    4
#    <type 'float'>
# 4. 1 + 2 * 5
#    11
#    <type 'int'>
# 5. delimiter * 5
#    ' .  .  .  .  . '
#    <type 'str'>
#
#
# Exercise 2.4
# 
# 1.
# r=5
# pi=3.14159
# r**3*pi*4/3
# 523..5983333333332
#
# 2.
# bp=24.95
# d=0.6
# sh1=3
# shs=0.75
# nbr=6=
# print bp*d+sh1+(nbr-1)*shs
# 62.22
#
# 3.
# dtime=6*60+52.0
# dist1=1.0
# speed1=(8+15/60)
# dist2=3.0
# speed2=(7+12/60)
# atime=(dtime+dist1*speed1+dist2+speed2)/60
# print atime
# 7.35
# (atime-7)*60
# 20.999
#
# So the arrival time is 7:21:00
